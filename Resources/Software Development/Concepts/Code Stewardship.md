> _One of the most important concepts for addressing a code base’s maintenance load is code stewardship—the trick (or really, the entire skill set) of keeping a code base maintainable._
> _Engineers are, for the most part, not incentivized to care about code stewardship. In fact, they’re incentivized to not care, because time and effort are zero sum games. Engineers receive more mentions, accolades, raises, and promotions from cranking out features than from investing time in code stewardship, so the former represents a massive opportunity cost of doing the latter._
