- [Strategic Tech Lead](https://keavy.com/work/thriving-on-the-technical-leadership-path/). Em vez de se especializar fortemente em algum nicho técnico, este cargo tem uma visão mais macro, e depende muitas vezes de criatividade para enxergar um possível futuro que atualmente é bem nebuloso
> So what does the more strategic work of a very senior engineer look like? It might include:

- Tackling technical challenges that span multiple technical and organizational systems.
- Researching and identifying the problems that could be worked on, a year or two from now.
- Developing prototypes to further explore and support ideas that come from that research.
- Ramping up strike teams to help build a thing.
- Looking at the big picture including cultural, product and technical challenges, to help inform choices that would be best for the org, perhaps with a 2-5 year view.
- Forming strategies, writing proposals and pitching them across the company, for new architecture, systems or approaches.
- Talking to engineers, technical writers, product managers, interface designers, sales people, lawyers, execs, competitors, peers, and users. Getting people onboard. Marketing ideas. Moving things forward.
- Acting as an advisor with internal teams, or in customer-facing groups.
- Sometimes being the voice for change, sometimes being the voice for not change. Always weighing up trade offs, always listening.
- Being slightly independent of the normal cadence of regular engineering project work. Probably having little guidance or oversight. Possibly being somewhat isolated. Being OK with that.
- Using that position of independence and power to support and influence other cool/hard/interesting challenges in the organization.
- Not being afraid: to question the status quo, to push back on decisions you think would be harmful, or to tackle challenges in unknown territory.
