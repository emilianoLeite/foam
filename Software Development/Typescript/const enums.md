# [Const Enums](https://robinpokorny.com/blog/typescript-enums-i-want-to-actually-use/)

The author goes into detail on all possible approaches to `enum` list the pros and cons of each approach.

They finally declare that their preferred way of using `enum` is as `const enum`, which are basically the same as string enums, but when transpiled don't generate JS code (the labels are replaced with the actual string values)

### *my opinion:*
If you don't care about the debuggability of the enums and/or the code generated by the enums, a simpler "string enum" is sufficient.
