# Anxiety/Angst

## [How the Way You Respond to Anxiety Changes Your Life - SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard on Angst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZQkby8bl8yE&ab_channel=PursuitofWonder)

- Book [The Concept of Anxiety](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Concept_of_Anxiety)

> What I really need to do is to get clear about "what am I to do", not what I must know...

- We will always have existential anxiety, it is a part of life.
- As long as we have choice (on what to do with our lives), we will have anxiety.
- Our north star should be our passion, our mission's life.
  - > ...the crucial thing is to find a truth **which is truth for me**,
    >
    > to find the idea for which I am willing to live and die.
